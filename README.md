# Facial_Emotion_Recognition_Using_Deep_Learning
DeepFER is a robust, real-time facial emotion recognition (*FER*) system leveraging cutting-edge deep learning methods. This project implements both **custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning** (using ResNet50V2) to classify seven fundamental human emotions from facial images .
