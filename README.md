# Facial_Emotion_Recognition_Using_Deep_Learning


---

**DeepFER** is a robust, real-time facial emotion recognition (*FER*) system leveraging cutting-edge deep learning methods. This project implements both **custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning** (using ResNet50V2) to classify seven fundamental human emotions from facial images ‚Äî optimized for real-world usability with **Streamlit & OpenCV** for instant image and webcam inference.
